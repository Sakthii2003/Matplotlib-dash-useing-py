âœ… Just Visualized Sales Data with Python & Matplotlib!
ðŸ“Š Today I explored a small Sales Dataset using Python in Jupyter Notebook, and visualized the data using different types of charts with the Matplotlib library.

Here's what I implemented:
ðŸ”¹ Line Chart â€“ to see the trend in sales over time
ðŸ”¹ Area Chart â€“ to represent cumulative sales visually
ðŸ”¹ Line Chart (with variation) â€“ to analyze fluctuations and patterns
ðŸ”¹ Column Chart â€“ to compare sales between different categories
ðŸ”¹ Scatter Plot â€“ to identify distribution and any potential correlation

ðŸ’» Tools Used:

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Matplotlib Library

ðŸ§  These basic visualizations help transform raw data into actionable insights â€“ great for any data-driven decision making!

ðŸš€ Just a small step in my #DataScience journey.
More visual stories coming soon. Stay tuned!
